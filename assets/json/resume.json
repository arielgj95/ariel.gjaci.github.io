      "summary": "The goal of my PhD was to create a hybrid rule-based and data-driven approach to generate culture-aware co-speech gestures on social robots. The rule-based part defines heuristic rules based on semantic scores from Cross-Encoder language models. The data-driven part generates co-speech gestures by implementing a multimodal, culture-aware generative model based on Diffusion-Transformers. The cultural component is analyzed from multimodal data and incorporated into the generated gestures, ensuring that the non-verbal communication of social robots is contextually and culturally appropriate.",
